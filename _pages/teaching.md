### Course Description

This course provides an in-depth introduction to systematic review and meta-analysis, with a focus on both theoretical concepts and practical applications. Students will begin by exploring the foundations of systematic reviews, including how to frame research questions and select relevant studies. As the course progresses, they will learn about effect size calculations, model selection, publication bias, and sensitivity analysis. Advanced topics such as network meta-analysis, multivariate meta-analysis, and Bayesian meta-analysis will also be covered. Throughout the course, students will use R software for analysis and apply these concepts through hands-on assignments and group projects.

### Course Prerequisites

Students are expected to have a basic knowledge of inferential statistics, linear regression, and ANOVA. Advanced mathematical knowledge (e.g., Calculus and Linear Algebra are NOT required). If you would like to review materials of the aforementioned topics, please see me early in the semester.

### Course Learning Outcomes

Students will conduct and present a synthesis of a set of outcomes, including a quantitative synthesis of effect sizes. Specifically, students will
Form research questions
Locate relevant studies (published and unpublished)
Identify and code pertinent study information, including potential moderator variables
Identify different types of study outcomes and select an effect-size metric to best represent those outcomes
Conduct appropriate data analyses, including but not limited to, homogeneity tests, overall effect-size tests, moderator models, and publication bias
Prepare a written report of the meta-analysis

Students will identify controversies and explain contradictory views about the major aspects of meta-analysis.

Homework Sets: There will be four Homework Sets throughout the semester. These assignments are directly related to readings and topics covered in class. All Homework Sets are intended to practice skills needed to complete your project. Several Homework Sets will provide practice using R to perform meta-analytic modeling techniques. Some Homework Sets will be explicitly related to your culminating project.

Project: This assignment will be a written report of the meta-analysis that you have worked on throughout the semester. The project will require the development of a coding sheet and search of computerized reference databases. Students are also expected to apply appropriate quantitative research synthesis methods to their data. The project is expected to be written in APA format. Further details on the project will be provided throughout the semester.

Project Presentation: Each student (or group) will complete a brief presentation related to their project. More details will be provided later in the semester.

### Additional Course Information Items

Computer Software
This course requires two computer programs:
	* Spreadsheet program
	* R and RStudio
We will use the spreadsheet program for the early parts of the course, mainly for data collection, organization, and some data cleaning. Once we begin to use statistical computations and analyses, we will shift to a computer software called R. This is a powerful statistical software commonly used by meta-analysts. As soon as possible, download R to your personal and/or office computer, preferably immediately after our first class! Both R and RStudio are free. Especially for first time users and those with less programming experience, I highly recommend RStudio as well. This is a companion program to R which is more user friendly.
	* R Download: 
	* R Studio Download: 

I will embed examples within lectures and post all code for topics in Canvas modules. If you ever need assistance with R, please let me know!
