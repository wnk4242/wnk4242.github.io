  <h1>Teaching Portfolio</h1>
  <p>This teaching portfolio is designed to showcase my adaptability and innovation in teaching methodologies, with a strong emphasis on inclusivity and accessibility, particularly in the post-COVID educational landscape. The portfolio contains the following components:</p>

  <h2>1. Syllabi</h2>
  <p>Two syllabi for my proposed courses are attached on pages 2 and 3, which include:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>An undergraduate course on data analysis.</li>
   <li>A graduate course on meta-analysis.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each syllabus contains the course description, textbook information, lecture outline, and assignments.</p>

  <h2>2. Tutorial Video</h2>
  <p>I have created and shared a detailed video tutorial on YouTube, which demonstrates my hands-on approach to teaching R coding. This video highlights my ability to explain complex statistical concepts clearly and engagingly through digital platforms:</p>

  <h2>3. Educational Website</h2>
  <p>I developed an interactive website to facilitate the teaching of data analysis and R programming in my proposed undergraduate course. The website is designed to support both in-person and remote learners, featuring resources that students can access asynchronously:</p>
