  <h1>Teaching Portfolio</h1>
  <p>This teaching portfolio is designed to showcase my adaptability and innovation in teaching methodologies, with a strong emphasis on inclusivity and accessibility, particularly in the post-COVID educational landscape. The portfolio contains the following components:</p>

  <h2>1. Syllabi</h2>
  <p>Two proposed syllabi, including an undergraduate course on data analysis and a graduate course on meta-analysis. Each syllabus contains the course description, textbook information, lecture outline, and assignments. You can access the syllabi <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uEb3iqwL2NEtLNgCh9Uxvkoj6l8NARsC/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

  <h2>2. Tutorial Video</h2>
  <p>I have created and shared a detailed video tutorial on YouTube, which demonstrates my hands-on approach to teaching R coding. This video highlights my ability to explain complex statistical concepts clearly and engagingly through digital platforms:</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wbXTFvaRnM&amp;t=766s" target="_blank">Watch the tutorial on YouTube</a></p>

  <h2>3. Educational Website</h2>
  <p>I developed an interactive website to facilitate the teaching of data analysis and R programming in my proposed undergraduate course. The website is designed to support both in-person and remote learners, featuring resources that students can access asynchronously:</p>
