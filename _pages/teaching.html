### Course Description

This course provides an in-depth introduction to systematic review and meta-analysis, with a focus on both theoretical concepts and practical applications. Students will begin by exploring the foundations of systematic reviews, including how to frame research questions and select relevant studies. As the course progresses, they will learn about effect size calculations, model selection, publication bias, and sensitivity analysis. Advanced topics such as network meta-analysis, multivariate meta-analysis, and Bayesian meta-analysis will also be covered. Throughout the course, students will use R software for analysis and apply these concepts through hands-on assignments and group projects.

### Course Prerequisites

Students are expected to have a basic knowledge of inferential statistics, linear regression, and ANOVA. Advanced mathematical knowledge (e.g., Calculus and Linear Algebra are NOT required). If you would like to review materials of the aforementioned topics, please see me early in the semester.

### Course Learning Outcomes
1. Students will conduct and present a synthesis of a set of outcomes, including a quantitative synthesis of effect sizes. Specifically, students will 
- Form research questions
- Locate relevant studies (published and unpublished)
- Identify and code pertinent study information, including potential moderator variables
- Identify different types of study outcomes and select an effect-size metric to best represent those outcomes
- Conduct appropriate data analyses, including but not limited to, homogeneity tests, overall effect-size tests, moderator models, and publication bias
- Prepare a written report of the meta-analysis

2. Students will identify controversies and explain contradictory views about the major aspects of meta-analysis.
