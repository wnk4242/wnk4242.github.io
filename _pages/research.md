Over the last decade, psychology has faced a replication crisis because efforts to replicate past study findings often fail to yield consistent results. Psychologists have conducted several large-scale multi-lab replication projects (such as the Many Labs series) to reassess the replicability of earlier findings. Major funding agencies (such as the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Health) have specific programs that offer funding opportunities to advance the science of replicability. I am currently pursuing three lines of research to enhance our understanding of research replicability, and I will delineate them in the following sections.

## Research Replicability

Psychologists are currently faced with a pressing methodological challenge: developing a universally accepted, empirically validated framework to evaluate outcomes of replications. The predominant approach is to compare p-values of original studies with their replications, which is increasingly being seen as inadequate. My dissertation proposes adopting the Bayesian hypothesis testing within a meta-analytic framework, marking the first step toward bridging this gap. This approach is implemented via the meta-analytic Bayes factor (MABF), which offers two distinct benefits. First, it leverages the enhanced statistical power inherent in meta-analytic methods; second, as a Bayesian method, it has the unique ability to make direct probability statements about hypotheses. 
Although methodologists have proposed various types of MABFs, these methods have not been extensively applied to evaluate replication studies. My dissertation explores the application of MABFs for this purpose. When applied to evaluate replication outcomes, they answer the following question: _“Do the pooled data from all replications support or refute the presence of the psychological effect?”_ More importantly, my research expands our understanding by answering an essential follow-up question: _“How often are our conclusions about the replicability of original studies incorrect, based on their replications?”_
