## Research Replicability
Over the last decade, psychology has faced a replication crisis because efforts to replicate past study findings often fail to yield consistent results. I am currently pursuing three lines of research to enhance our understanding of research replicability:

- The application of meta-analytic Bayesian hypothesis testing in the evaluation of direct replications

   A pressing methodological challenge in psychology is to develop a framework to evaluate outcomes of replications. My dissertation proposes adopting the Bayesian hypothesis testing within a meta-analytic framework and investigates how well such an approach answers the following question in computer simulations: _“Do the pooled data from all replications support or refute the presence of the psychological effect?”_ More importantly, my research expands our understanding by answering an essential follow-up question: _“How often are our conclusions about the replicability of original studies incorrect, based on their replications?”_ My long-term goal is to establish a statistical framework designed to assess the replications of advanced and complex research designs. 

- Credibility of research findings in educational psychology
  
   Statistical power plays a key role in ensuring the reliability, precision, and replicability of effect size estimation. In psychology, the average power is distressingly low—estimated at 36% with only 8% of studies deemed 
   adequately powered. The impact of such issues on educational psychology has not received the attention it deserves. I am currently researching the credibility of meta-analyses published in five 
   leading educational psychology journals between 2012 and 2022. Completion of this work will raise awareness within the academic community about the prevalence of under-powered research in top-tier journals. A working paper is [available here.](https://wnk4242.github.io/files/power paper.pdf)

- Effect size, heterogeneity, and power of direct replications

   Effect-size variability (also known as heterogeneity), is a key methodological factor that is frequently neglected in planning the sample sizes for replication studies. My research investigates several fundamental 
   questions regarding heterogeneity in replication studies and examines how the potentially linear relationship between effect sizes and heterogeneity may impact the statistical power of replications. Gaining a better 
   understanding of heterogeneity is key to improving sample size planning for future multi-lab replication projects. A working paper is [available here.](https://wnk4242.github.io/files/heterogeneity paper.pdf)

## Meta-analysis of Proportions

An important application of meta-analytic methods is pooling single proportions to estimate the overall prevalence of a specific condition. In 2017 alone, 152 meta-analyses of proportions were published across various scientific disciplines, such as medicine, public health, epidemiology, etc. These meta-analyses not only guide future research but also help policymakers make informed decisions. 

I wrote a comprehensive manuscript that was initially shared as a [preprint](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325486099_How_to_Conduct_a_Meta-Analysis_of_Proportions_in_R_A_Comprehensive_Tutorial/citations) on ResearchGate and has since evolved into a peer-reviewed publication. The paper offers clear, structured methodological guidance and specific designs for use with the R programming environment. It presents a step-by-step workflow and a critical review on common practices that could lead to biased effect estimates or misleading conclusions. Over the past five years, this methodological guide has garnered significant attention from the international research community, as evidenced by more than 52,000 reads on ResearchGate and 134 citations on Google Scholar:
