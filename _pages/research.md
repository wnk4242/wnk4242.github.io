## Research Replicability
Over the last decade, psychology has faced a replication crisis because efforts to replicate past study findings often fail to yield consistent results. Psychologists have conducted several large-scale multi-lab replication projects (such as the Many Labs series) to reassess the replicability of earlier findings. Major funding agencies (such as the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Health) have specific programs that offer funding opportunities to advance the science of replicability. I am currently pursuing three lines of research to enhance our understanding of research replicability, and I will delineate them in the following sections.

- The application of Bayesian meta-analysis in studies of research replicability

Psychologists are currently faced with a pressing methodological challenge: developing a universally accepted, empirically validated framework to evaluate outcomes of replications. I propose adopting the Bayesian hypothesis testing within a meta-analytic framework, marking the first step toward bridging this gap. In my research, I explore the application of meta-analytic Bayes factors for this purpose and how well they answer the following question: _“Do the pooled data from all replications support or refute the presence of the psychological effect?”_ More importantly, my research expands our understanding by answering an essential follow-up question: _“How often are our conclusions about the replicability of original studies incorrect, based on their replications?”_
