- Research Replicability

Over the last decade, psychology has faced a replication crisis because efforts to replicate past study findings often fail to yield consistent results.

Major funding agencies (such as the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Health) have specific programs that offer funding opportunities to advance the science of replicability. I am currently pursuing three lines of research to enhance our understanding of research replicability, and I will delineate them in the following sections.
