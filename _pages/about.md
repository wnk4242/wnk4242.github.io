My research is dedicated to addressing the replication crisis in psychologyâ€”an issue of paramount importance to the field. I have employed a combination of empirical evidence and computer simulations in my ongoing studies to investigate the key factors that threaten the success of replications. These factors include statistical power, effect size, and the often-overlooked effect size heterogeneity. Through these investigations, my research has estimated a "big picture" of the distributions of these factors, provided additional valuable data for researchers to explore, shed light on how these intertwined factors often hinder replication attempts, and ultimately has crucial implications for the design of future replication studies. My dissertation centers on quantifying replication success within the framework of Bayesian meta-analysis. This work holds great potential to aid future researchers in evaluating and designing replication studies more effectively. By providing a reliable framework for assessing replication success, we can foster a culture of rigorous and replicable research practices in psychology.
