# About me

My PhD journey is driven by a curiosity about how we can enhance research replicability. My work is dedicated to improving the evaluation and planning of close replications, as well as assessing the credibility of psychological findings. As an aspiring early-career researcher, my ultimate goal is to pioneer methods for guiding the science to make our research more robust and reproducible.

I also work on methodological issues in meta-analytic methods, with a particular focus on the meta-analysis of proportions. My comprehensive [methodological guide](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375451196_Conducting_Meta-analyses_of_Proportions_in_R) in this area has become a valuable resource in fields such as epidemiology, medicine, public health, and more. In my role as a meta-analyst, I am dedicated to developing, teaching, and advocating for the best practices in conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

My expertise encompasses a broad spectrum of statistical and methodological tools, including Monte Carlo simulations, Bayesian analysis, and advanced meta-analytic methods. With over a decade of experience in statistical programming using R, I am passionate about educating the public in R programming for the greater good. You can view my video tutorial to see a glimpse of my teaching approach in R, [available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wbXTFvaRnM&t=764s).
