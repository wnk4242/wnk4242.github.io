# About me ([View CV](https://wnk4242.github.io/files/CV_2025.pdf))

My PhD journey is driven by a curiosity about how we can enhance research replicability. My work is dedicated to improving the evaluation and planning of close replications, as well as assessing the credibility of psychological findings. As an aspiring early-career researcher, my ultimate goal is to pioneer methods for guiding science to make our research more robust and reproducible.

I also work on methodological issues in meta-analytic methods, with a particular focus on the meta-analysis of proportions. My comprehensive [tutorial](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375451196_Conducting_Meta-analyses_of_Proportions_in_R) in this area has become a widely referenced resource in fields such as epidemiology, medicine, public health, and more. I collaborate with researchers from diverse disiplines to conduct systematic reviews and meta-analyses. I have developed a research tool for systematic review called [CoviPanel](https://github.com/wnk4242/CoviPanel). It is a ChatGPT-assisted browser extension built for facilitating title and abstract screening in Covidence.

My expertise encompasses a broad spectrum of statistical techniques and tools, including Monte Carlo simulations, high-performance computing, Shiny App development, Bayesian analysis, mixed-effects modeling, among others. With nearly a decade of experience in statistical programming using R, I am passionate about educating the public in R programming for the greater good. You can view my video tutorial to see a glimpse of my teaching approach in R, [available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wbXTFvaRnM&t=764s).



One of the coolest computational skills I have learned is HPC. I conduct simulations on high-performance computing servers:

In my experience, using HPC—whether through university resources or cloud platforms—can make a huge difference on research. I was able to reduce the time for my large-scale simulation experiments (generating tens of millions of data points) from months to just a week or two. This efficiency allows for deeper and more ambitious research.
