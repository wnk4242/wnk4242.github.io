# About me

My PhD journey is driven by a curiosity about how we can enhance research replicability. My work is dedicated to improving the evaluation and planning of close replications, as well as assessing the credibility of psychological findings. As an aspiring early-career researcher, my ultimate goal is to pioneer methods for guiding science to make our research more robust and reproducible.

I also work on methodological issues in meta-analytic methods, with a particular focus on the meta-analysis of proportions. My comprehensive [tutorial](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375451196_Conducting_Meta-analyses_of_Proportions_in_R) in this area has become a widely referenced resource in fields such as epidemiology, medicine, public health, and more. I collaborate with researchers from diverse disiplines to conduct systematic reviews and meta-analyses. I have developed a systematic review tool, called CoviPanel, enabling faster AI-assisted abstract screening. You can find it on my GitHub page [here](https://github.com/wnk4242/CoviPanel).

My expertise encompasses a broad spectrum of statistical and methodological tools, including Monte Carlo simulations, Bayesian analysis, and advanced meta-analytic methods. With nearly a decade of experience in statistical programming using R, I am passionate about educating the public in R programming for the greater good. You can view my video tutorial to see a glimpse of my teaching approach in R, [available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wbXTFvaRnM&t=764s).
