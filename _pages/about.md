# About me

Hello and welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Educational Psychology at Texas A&M Univeristy. My primary research interest include methodological issues in the evaluation and planning of close replications, as well as assessing the replicability of psychological findings. My work makes use of a wide range of statistical and methodological tools, including Monte Carlo simulations, Bayesian analysis, and meta-analytic methods. 

In addition to research replicability, my work also focuses on improving meta-analytic methods, and my research currently centers on analyzing proportional data using meta-analysis. I have made a contribution to this field by publishing a comprehensive methodological guide on this subject.
