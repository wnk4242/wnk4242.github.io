# About me ([View CV](https://wnk4242.github.io/files/CV_2025.pdf))

My PhD journey is driven by a curiosity about how we can enhance research replicability. My work is dedicated to improving the evaluation and planning of close replications, as well as assessing the credibility of psychological findings. As an aspiring early-career researcher, my ultimate goal is to pioneer methods for guiding science to make our research more robust and reproducible.

I also work on methodological issues in meta-analytic methods, with a particular focus on the meta-analysis of proportions. My comprehensive [tutorial](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375451196_Conducting_Meta-analyses_of_Proportions_in_R) in this area has become a widely referenced resource in fields such as epidemiology, medicine, public health, and more. I collaborate with researchers from diverse disiplines to conduct systematic reviews and meta-analyses. I have developed a research tool for systematic review called [CoviPanel](https://github.com/wnk4242/CoviPanel). It is a ChatGPT-assisted browser extension built for facilitating title and abstract screening in Covidence.

My expertise encompasses a broad spectrum of statistical techniques and tools, including Monte Carlo simulations, high-performance computing, Shiny App development, Bayesian analysis, mixed-effects modeling, among others. With nearly a decade of experience in statistical programming using R, I am passionate about educating the public in R programming for the greater good. You can view my video tutorial to see a glimpse of my teaching approach in R, [available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wbXTFvaRnM&t=764s).



One of the coolest computational skills I've picked up for research is high-performance computing (HPC). I run large-scale simulations on HPC servers—like Grace, Texas A&M University's powerful computing cluster. Whether it's through university clusters or cloud-based platforms, HPC has completely transformed the way I do research. Tasks that would’ve taken months on a regular computer now wrap up in just a week or even days—while crunching through tens of millions of data points! This kind of power doesn’t just save time—it opens the door to more ambitious, complex, and exciting research questions.
