My primary area of research interest is the field of research replicability, which involves the evaluation and planning of exact replications as well as assessing the replicability of psychological findings. These research areas are still in their early stages, but they hold valuable theoretical and practical implications, as replicability is one of the fundamental pillars of science. My work makes use of a wide range of statistical and methodological tools, including Monte Carlo simulations, Bayesian analysis, and meta-analytic methods. In addition to research replicability, my work also focuses on improving meta-analytic methods, and my research currently centers on analyzing proportional data using meta-analysis. I have made a contribution to this field by publishing a comprehensive methodological guide on this subject.
