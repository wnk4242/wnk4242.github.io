# About me

Hello and welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Educational Psychology at Texas A&M Univeristy. My primary research interests include methodological issues in the evaluation and planning of close replications, as well as assessing the replicability of psychological findings. Ultimately, my mission, as a future methodoglogist and quantitative psychologist, is to establish how it is we can do more robust science.

I also work on methodological issues in meta-analytic methods. My current interest is meta-analysis of proportions. I have made a contribution to the scientific community by publishing a comprehensive [methodological guide](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375451196_Conducting_Meta-analyses_of_Proportions_in_R) on this subject. As a meta-analyst, my mission is to develop, educate, and promote best practices of conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

My work makes use of a wide range of statistical and methodological tools, including Monte Carlo simulations, Bayesian analysis, and meta-analytic methods. I have a solid ten years of experience of statistical programming in R. I believe in open science and am passionate about R education for the public good. An example of me teaching in R can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wbXTFvaRnM&t=764s).
