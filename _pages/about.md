# About me

Hello and welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Educational Psychology at Texas A&M Univeristy. My primary research interests include methodological issues in the evaluation and planning of close replications, as well as assessing the replicability of psychological findings. My work makes use of a wide range of statistical and methodological tools, including Monte Carlo simulations, Bayesian analysis, and meta-analytic methods. 

I also work on methodological issues in meta-analytic methods. My current interest is meta-analysis of proportions. I have made a contribution to the scientific community by publishing a [comprehensive methodological guide](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375451196_Conducting_Meta-analyses_of_Proportions_in_R) on this subject. As a future methodologist, my mission is to develop, educate, and promote best practices of conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses.
